Maybe I am going through mid-life crisis and I am looking for a change, or maybe programming has been always my calling. I started building basic static webpages with HTML 27 years ago. Then other things caught my interest and somehow I ended up with Mechanical Engineering degree - I blame it on 3 generations of Mechanical Engineers in my family, eventhough my dad has been always more inclined towards computer science. I took C++ programming class in college and Visual Basic for my Master's degree requirement, but that's as far as I got with programming.
I married a Dev Ops engineer and for last couple of years I've been watching him work from home and become very successful in what he does. He's been my inspiration all this time and I finally made that decision to become like him.

Programming is all around us with new apps and webpages popping up everyday. There is a constant need for developers and people who support them. There are many opportunities in today's world for programmers to make other people's lives easier and I would like to become one - be able to contribute. 

It is never too late for a career change :-)
